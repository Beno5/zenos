# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about:
    title: ABOUT
    description_part_one: Zenos as an idea was developed by two friends - Ema and Ena, actively thinking about how to connect the wealth of the workforce in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the business opportunities available in the world. Globalization, technological progress and, above all, the Internet, enabled the active work of employees from any part of the world, for a company located in any part of the world - if, and only if, there are knowledge and skills that can be applied and used. At the heart of our concept lies the principle of economic empowerment.
    description_part_two: Zenos is all about strengthening the capacity and enabling business opportunities. We prioritize empowering young people and women, along with other individuals eager to acquire and refine their skills and knowledge. Additionally, we assist organizations in building up their strategic positions by strengthening human capital, analyzing market opportunities, tracking trends, fostering social responsibility, and implementing cultural intelligence in diverse teams. A special emphasis is placed on supporting the food sector, where our focus is on advancing sustainable production and promoting the consumption of healthy food.

      text_part_one: "Embarking on a business venture with your best friend is a delicate dance that can either lead to perfection or disaster. The key lies in the authenticity of your friendship. Consider this: can you honestly criticize your friend's fashion choices if they appear less than stellar?"
      text_part_two: A successful business partnership with a best friend requires a delicate balance of sincerity, tact, and a shared understanding. If you can deliver candid feedback with both honesty and kindness, and if your friend can receive it as constructive rather than critical, then you may just be on the path to building a lasting and prosperous business together.
