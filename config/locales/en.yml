# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"

      title2: Who is the Talent Management Academy for?
      description1: <strong>Talent management is no longer a luxury reserved for large corporations.</strong>
        In today’s dynamic and unpredictable business environment, where labor market changes are a daily reality,
        organizations that want to achieve stable growth and competitive advantage must know how to identify, develop, and retain talent.
        <strong>This is not an option; it is a condition for sustainability and success.</strong>
      description2: <strong>That’s why we developed the Talent Management Academy – an educational program that offers concrete tools,
        knowledge, and strategies for identifying, developing, and retaining key people in the organization.</strong>
      description3: Talent management <strong>is not the same as traditional human resource management</strong>. While HR often deals with operational tasks – administration,
        records, and basic hiring processes – <strong>talent management is a strategic process that places key people at the center of long-term business development</strong>.

          "I work as a Senior Talent Partner in the IT industry and thought I already had a solid understanding of people management. However, the Talent Management Academy showed me how crucial it is to have a holistic, strategic approach to talent, especially for key roles and long-term development. Everything I learned can be immediately applied in practice – from employer branding to succession planning. The program is of exceptional quality, tailored to real-world challenges we face daily in the industry. I would recommend this training to every HR professional."

          "As the owner of a small IT company, I handle everything related to employees myself since I don’t have an HR department or associates focused on people. Until now, I lacked a clear strategy for developing and retaining key talent. The Talent Management Academy helped me learn how to approach these issues systematically. Since applying what I learned, I’ve seen a significant change: team relationships have improved, people are happier and more satisfied, and employee turnover has decreased significantly. For me, this has been one of the most valuable investments in my business development."
