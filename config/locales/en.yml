# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about:
    title: ABOUT
    description_part_one: Zenos started as an idea between two friends, Ema and Ena (yes, our names really are that similar!), who wanted to connect Bosnia and Herzegovina’s skilled workforce with global opportunities. By leveraging the internet and modern technology, we saw the potential for talented people to work anywhere in the world—as long as they have the right skills. Our mission focuses on economic empowerment, with a special emphasis on women and young people, through building the knowledge, skills, and networks needed for success.
    description_part_two: In addition to individuals, we also assist organizations through various team training sessions, support in developing various strategies, and fostering social responsibility and intercultural intelligence. 
    qoute:
      text_part_one: "Starting a business with your best friend is all about balance, with authenticity at the heart of it. It takes honesty, trust, and a shared vision to make it work—especially when you’re comfortable enough to give real feedback, even when it’s hard to hear."
      text_part_two: As challenging as it can be, building something together can turn out to be one of the most rewarding adventures of your life.
